New bot now available **(i dont remember which perm adding roles was so i j gave the bot invite admin you can change it when it joins if u want, Just make sure the bot has a higher role than the one u are trying to have auto equipped for your tag and the permission to add the roles to users **
 ** 1.** do /id then insert a user id of someone using ur tag so u can copy and paste the exact tag string to feed the bot in
** 2. **/setup when both have been done finally run
 **3.** /tagrole and the role u want auto applied for people wearing your tag 
after that wait because it takes awhile as this bot runs on my pc i have it wait between checking another user to avoid rate limits so it keeps working but it does have multi server support!!
